# web-based-learning-on-computational-thinking-skills
Computational thinking among yong computer scientists, especially those at the secondary school level has become a focus in this century. The earlier this skill set is built among young computer science students, the better their programming potentials can be realized. 
This web based learning course teaches the concept of program development, algorithm and flowchart. 

The target audience for this eLearning course is senior secondary computer science students. The program followed a branching programmed instruction approach whereby performance of students in each stage will determine the movement to the next stage. It is designed to support indiviudal learning pace. 
At the end of each lesson, a 10 multiple choice assessment test is given to the learners. If the student's performance is above 60%, he/she will be congratulated and allowed to move to the next lesson. However, if the performance is less than 60%, such learner will be redirected to advance learning contents for the same lesson, and be presented with the assessment test again to be retaken. Until the learner scores above 60%, he/she won't be allowed to proceed to the next lesson.
